general data analysis:
	mean,var,skew(conditional and unconditional)
	missing value analysis:
		proportion in each col
		proportion in each class
		

imputation:
	mean, median
	polyreg,NN,knn,trees:use last cols to impute first 500 cols (full info imputation)
	(DONE)density estimate: random sample from class conditioned density estimate

feature selection:
	PCA
	LDA
	dropped cols:
		(Done)SVM(linear)
		SVM(rbf)
		logreg
		storage:
			model
			best feature mask
			feature ranking 
			grid scores
			cross val accuracy vs dropped features graph

initial testing with only non missing cols:
	logreg: maxf1=27% with 1900 cols and C=1
	linear SVM:
